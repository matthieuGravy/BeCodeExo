Internet is a network of underground cables.

Each PC is identified by an IP address.

PCs are connected via a modem, and then to an Internet service provider.

The Internet service provider connects us to its server and then identifies us.

Once identified, it is possible to navigate to a chosen server, for example, to browse a website.

>To send an email, we go to the email service, and then send the email to the recipient. The email service sends it to the server and the Internet service provider, and then it goes to the recipient.

An image or a web page can be divided into packets. Once all the packets are grouped in the original order, they are displayed.

To prevent packets from not reaching their destination, machines are identified by an IP address. Routers intercept these packets and send them to the correct destination to avoid sending them to the wrong device connected to the network.

Internet reroutes data packets multiple times, adding or removing layers of information at each step, ensuring precise delivery to their destination.
